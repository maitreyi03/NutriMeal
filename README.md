# NutriMeal

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind NutriMeal stems from the desire to make healthy eating accessible and convenient. Many individuals face challenges in preparing nutritious meals due to time constraints or lack of culinary skills. NutriMeal aims to provide a solution by offering quick and easy recipes that prioritize health and taste.

## What it does
NutriMeal leverages the Edamam API to generate personalized recipes tailored to the user's preferences. By considering factors such as dietary restrictions, allergies, and desired flavors,
 the platform ensures that the suggested recipes align with individual needs and tastes.

## How we built it
Front-End Development:

 The front-end of NutriMeal was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and enhanced user experience.

Back-End Development: The back-end was developed using Python and Flask, providing a robust server for hosting the application and handling data processing.

API Integration: The Edamam API was integrated to provide access to a vast database of recipes and nutritional information, enabling NutriMeal to generate personalized recommendations.

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting Front-End to Back-End: One of the primary challenges encountered during development was establishing a smooth connection between the front-end and back-end components.

 Ensuring seamless data exchange and communication between these parts was crucial for the application's functionality.

Integrating Chart.js Library: The team attempted to incorporate the Chart.js library to enhance user engagement by visualizing nutritional data in an interactive manner. However, they faced difficulties in integrating this library effectively, leading to its exclusion from the final product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Connecting Front-End to Back-End: Successfully establishing a connection between the front-end and back-end components is a significant accomplishment, as it forms the foundation of the application's functionality.

## What we learned
- Expanding Recipe Database: Continuously expanding the recipe database to offer a wider variety of options for users.
- Improving User Interface: Refining the user interface to make it even more intuitive and visually appealing.
- Adding New Features: Implementing additional features such as meal planning, grocery list generation, and community interaction.
- Integrating Nutrition Tracking: Allowing users to track their nutritional intake and progress towards health goals.
